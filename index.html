	<h5>SECURITY DEPOSIT</h5>
	<p>Renter will be required to provide a security deposit to Owner in the amount of <strong>{{bFee|currency}}</strong> (“Security Deposit”) to be used in the event of loss or damage to the Rental Vehicle during the term of this agreement.  Owner may, in lieu of collection of a security deposit, place a hold on a credit card in the same amount.  In the event of damage to the Rental Vehicle, Owner will apply this Security Deposit to defray the costs of necessary repairs or replacement.  The Renter will be responsible for cost of damages or loss in full where no Partial Damage Waiver (see Section 10) is in place, Renter will be responsible for payment to the Owner of the balance of this cost.<br/><br/></p> 
	<p>The Renter forfeits refund of the Security Deposit and will cover any overages in liability where a Partial Damage Waiver is not in place if the following criteria are not met:<br/>
	i. Vehicles must be returned in a clean state inclusive of proper interior and exterior cleaning;<br/>
   ii. No smoke or excessive odors should be detected in the vehicle. Smoking inside the vehicle is strictly prohibited;<br/>

  vii. Vehicles should be returned without physical exterior damage, including but not limited to scrapes, dents, scratches, damaged or missing body parts, etc.;<br/>
 viii. Vehicles should be returned without physical interior damage, including but not limited to dirty, stained or torn seats, dirty roof, broken or missing internal accessories, etc.;<br/>
   ix. Vehicles should be returned without excessive mechanical damage, excluding typical wear and tear. If it is deemed that the Rental Vehicle has suffered excessive mechanical damage due to negligence on the part of the Renter, in addition to losing the Security Deposit and in lieu of a Partial Damage Waiver, they will be liable for full costs of repair to the damage, including but not limited to damaged or replaced parts, replacement of tires and/or rims due to negligent driving such as falling in potholes, riding curbs, etc.<br/>

     The Security Deposit cannot be used to cover the cost of a rental or the rental fee. Refunds on Security Deposits are processed within 24 hours of the return of the Rental Vehicle.<br/></p> 

     <h5>10. INSURANCE</h5>
     <p>The Rental Vehicle is covered under Third Party Liability Insurance, which is included under the quoted rates, and as such provisions made will be within the range of what is offered under this pre-existing contract.  This does not include personal injury, damage or destruction to the Renter, passengers or other persons or properties, which will be the sole liability of the Renter or responsible party as per designation of fault by the Law. The Renter assumes full responsibility for making any personal claims arising out of accidents.</p>
	<p>The Renter is responsible for the full value of the Rental Vehicle in the event of damage or loss. However, a Partial Damage Waiver* may be purchased that reduces the Renter’s financial liability in the event of loss or damage to the vehicle as long as there is compliance with the terms of the rental agreement. At the time of this Rental Agreement, the following Waiver Schedule was selected and paid for by the Renter:</p><br/>
	<p>☐ JMD $500.00 per day for damages up to but not exceeding JMD $25,000.00<br/>
	   ☐ JMD $1,000.00 per day for damages up to but not exceeding JMD $100,000.00<br/>
	   ☐ JMD $2,000.00 per day for damages up to but not exceeding JMD $250,000.00</p><br/>
	 <p>Where the cost of the damage, repair or replacement exceeds the amount covered by the Waiver Schedule selected, the Renter will be responsible for paying in full the difference between the Waiver cost and the cost of the repair or replacement.</p>
<p><i>* The Partial Damage Waiver is not insurance and is not mandatory; therefore, the Waiver may be declined. However, if the Renter declines the Waiver, he/she is responsible in full for the cost of damage to the Rental Vehicle up to the full value of the vehicle. The Partial Damage Waiver does not cover lost tools, keys, remote entry devices or spare tires where applicable.</i></p><br/>

	<h5> 11. PROCEDURES FOR DAMAGES TO RENTAL VEHICLE, ACCIDENTS, CONFISCATION, THEFT,  LOSS AND/OR REPOSSESSION</h5>
<p>	Where the Rental Vehicle sustains any damages, including by not limited to, scratches, dents, damaged or destroyed interior or exterior body parts, it is the responsibility of the Renter to inform the Owner immediately and return the vehicle for a mandatory inspection and evaluation.

The Renter should inform the Owner immediately if the Rental Vehicle is confiscated by the Police or any other party, and will be liable for any charges related to confiscation, transport and/or release of the vehicle. 
It is the responsibility of the Renter to secure the Rental Vehicle at all times. The Owner reserves the right to cease this Agreement immediately without refund of any fees paid should the vehicle be observed or reported to be in any situation that may result in damage, loss or theft of the vehicle. This includes but is not limited to, dangerous and reckless driving, unsecure parking, illegal activities, any breach or contravention of the Road Traffic Act, etc. If the vehicle is stolen, the Renter should inform the Owner immediately and the Agreement will cease with immediate effect. Any balance of fees paid will be refunded only upon proof that the Renter had taken adequate measures to secure the vehicle. 
The Renter will be responsible in full for loss of the vehicle, unless a third party to this arrangement is deemed responsible and identified as liable for same. The Renter will owe in full the value of the Rental Vehicle minus any costs covered under the Partial Damage Waiver. 
If for any reason the Owner has to disable and subsequently retrieve the Rental Vehicle, a fine of JMD $10,000.00 for areas within a 30 km radius of the office and JMD $15,000.00 for areas beyond a 30 km radius of the office will be charged for repossession and retrieval. This includes but is not limited to, non-payment of fees, threats to the safety and security of the vehicle, theft or accidents, excessive and repeated notifications of speeding, inquiry or direction by the Police and/or other law enforcement, etc.</p><br/>

<h5> 12. INDEMNIFICATION</h5>
